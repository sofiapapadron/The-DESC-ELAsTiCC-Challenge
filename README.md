# The-DESC-ELAsTiCC-Challenge

The purpose of ELAsTiCC ("Extended LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge") is to spur the creation and testing of an end-to-end real-time pipeline for time-domain science. The challenge starts with a simulation of ~5 million detected events that includes ~50 million alerts. These alerts will be streamed from LSST to brokers, who will classify the events and send new alerts with classifications back to DESC. A talk about ELAsTiCC given at the LSSTC Enabling Science Broker Workshop in 2021 can be [found on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGM_0110DDU&list=PLFA428AMRhwADMFsNDC1dttTyIukPhADi&index=30). Two posters on ELAsTiCC given at conferences can be found below on this page.

For discussion or questions about the challenge, use the #elasticc-comms channel on the DESC Slack.

The first ELAsTiCC campaign ran from September 2022 until early January 2023. Metrics and diagnostics from that campaign can be found on the [ELAsTiCC page of the DESC TOM](https://desc-tom.lbl.gov/elasticc/) (login required).

The Second ELAsTiCC campaign (dubbed ELAsTiCC2) ran from mid-November to mid-December 2023, streaing alerts at ~3Ã— the rate of the first campaign. Diagnostics and some metrics from that campaign can be found on the [ELAsTiCC2 page of the DESC TOM](https://desc-tom.lbl.gov/elasticc2/) (login required).

There is a new github repository for ELAsTiCC-related code and information: [LSSTDESC/elasticc](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/elasticc).
